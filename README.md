# 42-Piscine

## Description

This repository contains the projects I did during the 42 Piscine. The 42 Piscine is an intensive selection process that lasts 4 weeks. It teaches the basics of programming and the basics of the UNIX system. The Piscine is a great opportunity to learn a lot in a short amount of time and to meet a lot of people. The Piscine is also a great opportunity to get into 42, a great coding school.
